**ortho-db: An Open Source Database of Eastern Orthodox Christian Texts**

This is a proof of concept. This README provides a general overview of the project. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/franswan/ortho-db/wiki) to explore what this project can provide a foundation for. 

## Overview

ortho-db is an open-source project aimed at creating a comprehensive database of Eastern Orthodox Christian texts. The database will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, scholars, and language models interested in exploring the rich literary and theological heritage of Eastern Orthodoxy. This README provides an outline of the project, considerations for contributors, and the proposed database schema for organizing the content.

## Project Goals

- **Compilation of Eastern Orthodox Texts**: ortho-db seeks to collect and organize a wide range of Eastern Orthodox Christian texts, including prayers, the Creed, books of the Bible, works of the Church Fathers, and hagiographies of saints.
    
- **Multilingual Support**: The database will strive to include texts in their original languages (e.g., Greek, Russian, Slavonic) along with translations in various languages to foster accessibility.
    
- **Public API**: orthod-db aims to provide a public API, making it easier for developers and researchers to programmatically access the texts and relevant metadata.
    
- **Collaborative Community**: We encourage collaboration with experts, scholars, and enthusiasts in Eastern Orthodox theology and linguistics to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the database.

- **Documentation**: Improve the project's documentation, including guidelines for contributors, API usage, and data sources.
    
- **Bug Fixes and Enhancements**: Contribute by fixing bugs, implementing new features, and optimizing performance.
    
- **Community Engagement**: Engage with the community, discuss ideas, and provide feedback on proposed changes.
    

## Database Schema

The proposed database schema aims to logically organize the content types found in Eastern Orthodox Christian texts. The schema will consist of the following main entities:

1. **Texts**: Representing individual texts, such as prayers, liturgical texts, and writings of Church Fathers and saints.
    
2. **Authors**: Storing information about the authors of the texts, including their names and biographical details.
    
3. **Languages**: Maintaining a list of languages in which the texts are available, along with language codes.
    
4. **Translations**: Storing translated versions of the texts, linked to their original counterparts and language information.
    
5. **Categories**: Organizing texts into categories (e.g., Doctrinal Writings, Liturgical Texts, Lives of Saints) for easy navigation.
    
6. **Bible Books**: Holding information about the books of the Bible, along with chapters and verses.
    
7. **References**: Allowing cross-referencing between different texts within the database.
    

The proposed schema will foster relationships between these entities, ensuring a flexible and well-structured database.
